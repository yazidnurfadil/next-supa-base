# Organisms Components

This folder contains the organism components of this project. Each component here represents a more complex UI element that is composed of multiple atomic and molecular components. These organisms can be combined to create full pages or sections of a page.

## Structure

- Each component is self-contained and includes its styles, logic, and any necessary assets.
- Components are designed to be reusable and composable, allowing for flexibility and scalability in building UI interfaces.
- Components are organized into subfolders based on their category or functional grouping. For example, components related to navigation are grouped together in the `navigation` subfolder.
