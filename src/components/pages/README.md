# Pages Components

This folder contains the page components of this project. Each component here represents a full page or section of a page. These components can be used as a starting point for building a UI interface.

## Structure

- Each component is self-contained and includes its styles, logic, and any necessary assets.
- Components are designed to be reusable and composable, allowing for flexibility and scalability in building UI interfaces.
- Components are organized into subfolders based on the page itself. For example, components related to dashboard are grouped together in the `dashboard` subfolder.
